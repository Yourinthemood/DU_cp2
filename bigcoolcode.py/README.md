# Personal Library Manager

A Python program to keep track of my book collection! This program lets you add, view, update, and delete books from your library. All your books are saved in a CSV file so they're still there next time you run the program.

## What's in the library?
- The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
- A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle
- Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson
- The Horse and His Boy by C.S. Lewis
- The Giver by Lois Lowry

## Files in this project
